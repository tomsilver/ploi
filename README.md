Instructions for running (tested on Mac and Linux):
* Use Python 3.6 or higher.
* Download Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Make sure the directory containing this code is in your PYTHONPATH.
* Download and build the plan validation tool available at https://github.com/KCL-Planning/VAL, then make a symlink called `validate` on your path that points to the `build/Validate` binary, e.g. `ln -s <path to VAL>/build/Validate /usr/local/bin/validate`. If done successfully, running `validate` on your command line should give an output that starts with the line: "VAL: The PDDL+ plan validation tool".

Now, `./run.sh` should work. Different domains and methods can be run by modifying the variables at the top of run.sh.
